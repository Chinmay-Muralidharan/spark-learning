## ✅ Day 4 — Delta Lake Basics (Parquet + Reliability)
**Main Goal:** Store cleaned/transformed data in Delta format and understand Delta table internals.

**Notes:**
- Converted dataset to Delta format using `.format("delta")`
- Observed Parquet part-files + `_delta_log` folder
- Learned `_delta_log` tracks commits and supports version history (time travel)
