Day 4 — Delta Lake Introduction

Today I learned the basics of Delta Lake and how it extends Parquet to make data storage more reliable in Databricks.

What I did

Converted the ecommerce events dataset into Delta format

Saved Delta data to a storage path using PySpark

Explored the generated files inside the Delta folder

Key Observations

Delta stores data as multiple Parquet part-files

Delta also creates a _delta_log folder

The _delta_log contains transaction log JSON files, which help track table versions and enable time travel/version history

Key Takeaway

Delta Lake = Parquet storage + transaction log, making datasets more structured and reliable for analytics workflows.
