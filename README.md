# 🚀 Databricks + PySpark E-Commerce Analytics Project (14-Day Challenge)

This repository documents my learning journey in **Databricks Community Edition** using **PySpark** on a real-world **e-commerce events dataset**.  
The goal is to build strong fundamentals in **data exploration, transformation, feature engineering, and Delta Lake storage**.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Learn how to work with large datasets using **Apache Spark**
- Perform safe and scalable **data exploration**
- Create derived features for analysis (**feature engineering**)
- Store structured datasets using **Delta Lake**
- Build workflows that are relevant for a **Data Analyst role**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech Stack
- **Databricks Community Edition**
- **Apache Spark / PySpark**
- **Spark SQL**
- **Delta Lake**
- Dataset: **E-commerce events** (views / clicks / cart / purchase)

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains event-level user activity such as:
- `event_time`
- `event_type` (view / cart / purchase)
- product + category details
- user + session identifiers
- `price` and `brand`

This dataset is useful for analytics tasks like:
- funnel analysis
- pricing segmentation
- category-level insights
- user session behavior
